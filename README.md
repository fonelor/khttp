kHttp Android is similar to Python's `requests` module. This library has been adapted from [kHttp by jkcclemens](https://github.com/jkcclemens/khttp) which is no longer maintained.

#### GETTING STARTED
kHttp Android (pre-)releases are available via JitPack. It is recommended that  a specific release version is selected when using the library in production as there may be breaking changes at anytime.

> **Tip:** Test out the canary channel to try out features by using the latest develop snapshot; `develop-SNAPSHOT`.

```Groovy
// Project level build.gradle.kts
// ...
repositories {
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
}
// ...

// Module level build.gradle.kts
dependencies {
    // Replace version with release version, e.g. 1.0.0-alpha, -SNAPSHOT
    implementation "io.karn:khttp-android:[VERSION]"
}
```

#### USAGE
The most basic case is as follows:

```Kotlin
// Get your IP synchronously
val ipAddress = get(url = "http://httpbin.org/ip").jsonObject.getString("origin")

// Get your IP asynchronously
get(url = "http://httpbin.org/ip")
    .subscribe { response : Response ->
        val ipAddress = response.jsonObject.getString("origin")
    }
```

#### KNOWN ISSUES

- There is an issue with parsing a list of maps into a JSONObject â€” a test case `doesJSONObjectBugExist` documents the issue within the `KHttpPostTest.kt` file. This is platform related and cannot be fixed through this library. The current workaround is to build the JSONObject manually. 

#### CONTRIBUTING
There are many ways to [contribute](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md), you can
- submit bugs,
- help track issues,
